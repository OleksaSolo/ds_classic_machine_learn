# ds_classic_machine_learn
Classical machine learning. Linear regression. Retraining.

The task will be completely related to linear regression and its implementation. Let's divide the task into several parts:

- write the linear regression hypothesis function in vector form;
- let's create a function to calculate the loss function in vector form;
- we implement one step of gradient descent;
- we will find the best parameters for the dataset predicting the house price depending on the area, the number of bathrooms and the number of bedrooms;
- we will find the same parameters using an analytical solution and carry out comparison of the obtained results
